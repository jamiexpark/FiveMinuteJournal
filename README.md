# 5 Minute Journal 

Hello! My name is Jamie, and I believe that journalling is really important for everyone to do, no matter what stage in life their in, whenever and wherever they are. The 5 minute journal in an easy way to introduce yourself to journalling, while also showing gratitude for your life and gaining consistentency and building good habits. I wanted a way for people on the go, and also people (like me) who are easily forgetful to participate in the 5minute journal through a website that will later be built as a chrome extension that will pop up during the time period you set that you want to start and end your day. 

Day 1 of Speed running this 6/17/2023:
so i basically had the BASIC basic html layout for this... but didnt know how to implement the time and like make it pretty. i learned about js functions embedded inside html (crazy!) and tried to make it a little cooler! I also added lots more input fields and most importantly, finally got it working on github pages!!!!! 

Day 2 of being bored af and having nothing to do all day 6/18/2023:
I love treating github as a diary. Today, i made the time work! i still need to do some more tests if its completely right, but now you can only input when its within the timeframe and the site will remeber your timeframe as well. i made a ton of figma files and animations, and imported some of those assets but still unsure on how to animate. i animated the "sunrise" though and im gonna work on a sunset for the night time. i created a lot of new files and got the basics up and going. i have a header and completely redid my index.html. just... a lot. proud of myself.
